drivers are confronted with non-optimal circumstances regarding wheather and 
road conditions.
The goal of this project is to provide a guidline on how to reduce the risk 
of having a trafic accident.
In this regard, it will be attempted to predict the risk of having accident 
under given circumstances.
The calculated risk can be used as a metrics to decide whether the trip should 
be delayed or an alternative route or means of transportation should be used.
