The available dataset provides a collection of many accidents 
with many details (=features) on the occurrence.
It is the aim ofthis project to identify certain correlations 
of these features with the probability and severity of accidents.

The extensive number of features is collected, with sometimes 
very high degree of detail. E.g. the type of involved party 
as well as their direction of movement when the accident occurred, 
are separated.
Attention needs to be paid for missing information. Due to 
non-continuous (categorical) features, it would make sense 
to exclude samples (rows) with incomplete set of features.
